TODO:
-allow non-uniform amplitude exchanges, instead of always magnitude eps
-better support for returning y(t) at intermediate granularity
-oscillators should store their own state variable (as node data)
-better integrators that handle threshold crossings

QUESTIONS:
-don't store distances in a matrix?  This will be bad for very large graphs . . .
-why the min(i+dtau+1,Tf) thing?  If the pulse is going to be added after the end of the simulation, shouldn't you just ignore it?
